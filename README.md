## Requirments
- Works with Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- SSH passwordless login

## Secure Shell Setup
### Generate SSH Key Pair
The system running `Butter` should be able to login into each device through SSH without a password. So, generate SSH key pair and copy the public key to all other devices.
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
### Copy the Public Key
```bash
ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.0.XXX
```

## Installation
1. Clone the `butter` repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloud-and-smart-labs/butter.git
```

2. Install the package
```bash
pip install butter
```

### Enabling Command Auto-completion
- Linux Systems (Bash Shell)
```bash
_BUTTER_COMPLETE=bash_source butter > ~/.butter-complete.bash && echo '. ~/.butter-complete.bash' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```
- MacOS (zsh Shell) <br>
The completion system needs to be activated. Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.zprofile`
```bash
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```
Then enabling Auto-completion
```bash
echo 'eval "$(_BUTTER_COMPLETE=zsh_source butter)"' >> ~/.zprofile && source ~/.zprofile &&  echo 'eval "$(_BUTTER_COMPLETE=zsh_source butter)"' >> ~/.zprofile && source ~/.zprofile
```

## Walk Through
Butter has two types of commands:
1. `inventory:` Creates inventory that contains the SSH details of hosts
2. `Exe`cute: Executes the commands on inventories

```bash

```bash
butter inventory create demo
```
```bash
butter inventory create demo_1 demo_2 demo_3
```
2. Add hosts into the inventory `demo`
```bash
butter inventory add demo root@172.17.0.3 root@172.17.0.4
```
3. Get list of inventories
